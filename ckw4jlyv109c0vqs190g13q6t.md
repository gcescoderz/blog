## Information Technology

Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. 
	IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. 
	IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT).An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.

History of computer technology

	Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick.
	The Antikythera mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism.
	 Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.

Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine.
	During the Second World War, Colossus developed the first electronic digital computer to decrypt German messages. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task.
	It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.
	The first recognizably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Baby, which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.


Electronic data processing
	

Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.
	Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.

The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode ray tube,but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. 
	The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.


Databases :


	Database Management Systems (DMS) emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. 
	An early such system was IBM's Information Management System (IMS),which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later.
	IMS stores data hierarchically,but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables, rows ,and columns.

	In 1981, the first commercially available relational database management system (RDBMS) was released by Oracle.
	All DMS consist of components, they allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity.
	 All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema.



Data retrieval :
	The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured Query Language (SQL), based on relational algebra.
	The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully.

	Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats even within a single organization. 
	Data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems (DSS).


Data transmission :
	IBM card storage warehouse located in Alexandria, Virginia in 1959. This is where the government kept storage of punched cards.
	Data transmission has three aspects transmission, propagation, and reception. 

	It can be broadly categorized as broadcasting, in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or telecommunications, with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels.
	XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s,particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented protocols such as SOAP,describing "data-in-transit rather than... data-at-rest".


Data manipulation :
	
Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of Moore's law machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007.

	The per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades.the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months.
	The world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years.
