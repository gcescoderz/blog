## Benefits of coding

1. Coding can help you understand technology

Technology is everywhere in the modern world and continues to develop at an astonishing rate. Coding already plays a key part in this technological evolution and will become increasingly important in light of new robotics and automated technologies. Learning to code will give you the tools you need to go on and be part of shaping the future. This could include roles in RPA, building automated systems for global banks or healthcare organisations, or even helping to improve the tech in self-driving cars - this is just scratching the surface!

2. It can enhance problem-solving skills

Coding can help you improve your logical thinking skills by allowing you to see problems from a new perspective. Complex coding projects are made up of smaller tasks and by breaking down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking, you can tackle any challenge. This can be applied to any scenario in both your personal and professional life.

3. Coding can be applied to data visualisation

Working with coding languages, such as SQL and Python can provide excellent practice for data analysis and visualisation. These skills are beneficial for designing complex data dashboards and reports, which are vital for making data more accessible and easy to understand. In addition, coding is a skill that can be applied to various roles for data purposes, even outside of the technology industry. Take marketing, for instance: you can use data skills you have learnt from coding to understand performance data or customer trends and use this to inform your marketing strategy.
4. Coders are part of a community

As a coding enthusiast, there are benefits in joining a programming or coding community. It is an opportunity to share knowledge, advice, and skills with like-minded people. At FDM, we host regular hackathons, events where our consultants can work as a team and code. Some of our hackathons have included working together to program a robot, as well as designing a game from scratch.
