## Is Coding Hard to Learn? 
(Answer:No)

No. Coding is not hard to learn. Infact "Anyone can learn coding", if they have dedication, persistence and patience.


Just like other skills Learning to code takes a good amount of time and persistence.Coding is thought to be hard because its a type of skill that its unlike anything most of us have ever experienced before.However its not easy to start,its not a rocket science or its not as impossible as it might seem.The simple and important thing about coding is as it requires the ability to think not the ability to remember or type. 

              Learning developer skills is the excellent way to start your career. Coding is the fundamental skill for jobs such as software development. 

Once you start to learn the art of staring at the computer screen and putting hours to  solve a problem, you are a lot closer to reaching your goal of being a good programmer.
