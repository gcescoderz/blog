## Automatic language Translator

Automatic language Translator
        
			Automatic language Translator was a machine translation system that converted Russian documents into English.it is used an optical disk that stored 170,000 word-for-word and statement -for-statement translations at high speed.
 

The translator was installed in  1959 , dramatically upgraded in 1964,and was eventually  replaced by a mainframe running SYSTRAN in 1970.
The translator began in a June 1953 contract from the US Navy to the ITC of Los Angeles. Then the system was developed by Gilbert King with a team included Louis Ridenour. It evolved into a 16-inch plastic disk , only the 4 inch only used as a storage that had an access about 1 Mbit/sec.

How does it work?
                                This translator software system interprets the structure of sentences  in the source language and generates a translation based  on the rules of the target language.
⦁	Neural machine translation uses an artificially produced neural network.
⦁	This networks require a fraction of the memory needed  by statistical methods.
⦁	It is the process by which computer software used to translate a text from one  natural language to any another  language.
Applications:

⦁	It is possible to translate large swathes of text in a very short time.
⦁	It can translate text , documents and websites from one language into another.
⦁	It have been used in many applications scenario such as business travel ,tourism ,cross-language information retrieval and so on.
⦁	In terms of object of translation , there are written language-object oriented text translation and spoken language-object phonetic translation.
⦁	Machine translation is better than human translation because human translation is complex and requires time.
