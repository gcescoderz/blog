## Data science fun facts


When you think of data, you typically think of lines of code and
numbers. But data science can be used for some truly spectacular things,
and you could play a game of Two Truths and a Lie with some of these.
1. An AI-generated text prediction model was trained to write a Harry
Potter novel.
2. The earliest case of data visualization being used to influence public
policy was around getting better sanitary conditions for British
soldiers.
3. AI-powered bees are being developed by the Wyss Institute in Boston
to be used in crop pollination, climate monitoring, and surveillance,
among other things.
4. The City of Chicago used R to predict which restaurants were likely to
commit violations in sanitation inspections, based on factors such as
time since last inspection, the number of nearby sanitation
complaints, and the type of facility being inspected. Prioritizing these
outlets for review, they were able to discover violators one week
earlier on average.
5. An AI-powered software was created that could predict the results of
the Oscars with 90% accuracy.
6. Many businesses make heavy use of Python, but Dropbox was
built almost exclusively on the programming language when it was
started up in 2008. So integral was Python to Dropbox that in 2013
they managed to convince Guido van Rossum, Python’s creator, to join
their staff. He agreed, on the condition that he wouldn’t be put in a
managerial or leadership role.
