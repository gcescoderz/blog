## Google Assistant




Google Assistant is an artificial intelligence–powered virtual assistant developed by Google that is primarily available on mobile and smart home devices. Unlike the company's previous virtual assistant, Google Now, the Google Assistant can engage in two-way conversations.


Google Assistant originally launched on the Google Pixel smartphones and Google Home, but it is now available to just about all modern Android devices, including Wear OS devices, Android TV, and Nvidia Shield, as well as any cars that support Android Auto and other devices too, like Nest cameras and the Lenovo Smart Clock.

Google Assistant offers voice commands, voice searching, and voice-activated device control, letting you complete a number of tasks after you've said the "OK Google" or "Hey Google" wake words. It is designed to give you conversational interaction. It can also recognise voice profiles for different people, so it knows who is talking to it and can tailor the responses accordingly. You can also ask for multiple things at the same time.

Google Assistant can help you to conduct a conversation in dozens of languages. Just say "Hey Google, be my Spanish interpreter" to start Interpreter Mode and get real time spoken and (on Smart Displays) written translation to aid the conversation.
As a default option, the Google Assistant doesn't support two common features of the speech recognition on the transcribed texts, like punctuation and spelling. However, a Beta feature of Speech-to-text enables only English (United States) language users to ask "to detect and insert punctuation in transcription results". Speech-to-Text can recognize commas, question marks, and periods in transcription requests.
