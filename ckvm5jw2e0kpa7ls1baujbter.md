Code or programming scripts is the building blocks of every software, application or website.  It is the foundation on which we build our entire digital presence. And while it one,a popular, famous software from one that nobody uses . In other words, when it comes to software, coding is what can make all difference between good, bad and unusable. 
We are living in times where we need software for pretty much everything. Because of high speed mobile internet we have to rely on software and websites for everything, including entertainment, banking, shopping, travel and more. Additionally, the digitization of a number of processes aided by government initiatives has helped us turn into a digital first altogether. 

While there was a time when a regular website with functional features was more than enough for most people, now every products needs to have an e-store, customer support and more embedded into their digital persona. 

Conclusion:  As a result whether you are an entrepreneur, employee or coder, coding is extremely relevant to business across the board.
