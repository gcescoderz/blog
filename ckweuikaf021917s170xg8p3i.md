## Fuzzy logic



Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on "degrees of truth" rather than the usual "true or false" (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based.

Fuzzy logic in AI

In artificial intelligence (AI) systems, fuzzy logic is used to imitate human reasoning and cognition. Rather than strictly binary cases of truth, fuzzy logic includes 0 and 1 as extreme cases of truth but with various intermediate degrees of truth.

As a result, fuzzy logic is well-suited for the following:

engineering for decisions without clear certainties and uncertainties, or with imprecise data -- such as with natural language processing technologies; and
regulating and controlling machine outputs, according to multiple inputs/input variables -- such as with temperature control systems.
IBM's Watson supercomputer is one of the most prominent examples of how variations of fuzzy logic and fuzzy semantics are used.
