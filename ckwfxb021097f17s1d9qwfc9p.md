## What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is the process of translating large data sets and metrics into charts, graphs and other visuals. The resulting visual representation of data makes it easier to identify and share real-time trends, outliers, and new insights about the information represented in the data. 
 

A dashboard is an information visualization tool. It helps you monitor events or activities at a glance by providing insights on one or more pages or screens. Unlike an infographic, which presents a static graphical representation, a dashboard conveys real-time information by pulling complex data points directly from large data sets. An interactive dashboard makes it easy to sort, filter, or drill into different types of data as needed. Data science techniques can be used to identify what is happening, why it's happening, and what will happen next at speed.


As the amount of big data increases, more people are using data visualization tools to access insights on their computer and on mobile devices. Dashboards are used by business people, data analysts, and data scientists to make data-driven business decisions.
