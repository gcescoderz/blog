## Will Metaverse Be The Future Of   Internet ?


      As we all heard the word "METAVERSE" for the past two weeks. There is big question for everyone. Is Metaverse the future of internet? The answer is definitely yes. Metaverse is a hypothesized next iteration of the internet consisting of online 3-D virtual environments that people can access through virtual reality (VR) headsets, smartphones, PCs, game consoles and other devices.

The core advantage of the Metaverse is the identification and realization of novel applications that would revolutionize the way individuals use the internet and other related digital communication technologies. Companies such as Microsoft and Meta have recognized the fact that the future of the internet and digital communication is headed toward a more immersive digital realm that reduces the boundaries between the physical world and the virtual world. Zuckerberg and the people behind Meta Platforms recognize the capability of technology to allow people to connect and express themselves more naturally. But, current social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, as well as communication platforms such as Zoom restrict digital human interaction within a two-dimensional plane.Big Tech has set their eyes on developing and deploying their version of the Metaverse.

Most of the companies like The NVIDIA corporation, Blender,Adobe,Roblox Corporation,Unity Software Inc.,Snap Inc.,Autodesk and Facebook Meta invested billions of dollars on Metaverse especially on the seven layers of the Metaverse to make better environment and infrastructure.


Metaverse is not a dream anymore, it's now coming to reality, and our real world is getting more virtual in the coming days due to this technology. With time, Virtual reality will develop and will take our experiences to a new level. Many people will get employment through this technology, and millions will get a new technological wonder to experience. Every technology has its own negative and positive points, and for Metaverse, you can figure them out when it will come to reality.
