## Email spam and malware filtering

Email spam and malware filtering:
 
Email spam:
                      Email spam is unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Email spam is also known as junk spam. Spam is often compared to junk emails, but those two are completely different terms since junk mail is not and gives options to unsubscribe from it.
   
 
History and purpose of email spam:
                      Spam emails gained real traction with the rise of the Internet and instant email communication in the early 90s. Their primary goal is to lure the user into clicking a malicious link or download an attachment that is harmful to the userâ€™s machine.

The first virus spread caused by spamming happened in 1999. There were no anti-spam laws, professional spammers were free to do whatever they liked. Spammers even have a self-proclaimed spam king, Sandford Wallace. Wallace was one of the biggest email spammers, who also spammed users on Myspace and Facebook.

Simple ways to filter spam emails:
 1. Spam filtering tools and anti-virus software can help to scan the emails that you received for malware. If the emails that you received for malware, the malicious content would be quarantined and we would be prevented from opening it. This helps to alleviate the chance of emails containing malware from infecting your computer.
2.Avoid using personal or business email address when registering in any online contest or service such as applications, deal updates etc.
Many spammers watch these groups or emailing lists to harvest new email addresses.
3.A Third party solution vets incoming emails before they reach you. Only the ones deemed acceptable will travel to your email server. If our server is down, we can still get our email.
4.Do not reply to spam messages-Almost all spam messages are malicious email  sent  by  unknown sources. These sources could be hackers who aim to hack into the computers of their victims.
Never respond to spam messages because through this, the spammer will know that the email address is active and thus, it increases the chance of your email to be constantly targeted by the spammer.
