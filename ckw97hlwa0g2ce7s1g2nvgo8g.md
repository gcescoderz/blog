## New Data Science Standards Are Needed for a Data-Filled World. Here’s What We Propose

For more than a century there have been calls to increase "statistical literacy." And such cries have grown even louder in recent years, with the rise of big data and fast computing.


Research has shown that students are not being well prepared to be critical consumers of data and online resources, which has led to concerns about a threat to our democracy, which relies on voters’ ability to sort truths from lies. On the other hand, the emerging field of data science, defined as a synthesis of statistics, mathematics and computer science, promises to provide students with powerful problem-solving strategies they will use in the workplace and their daily lives. And the need for people who can reason with data in almost all jobs in all sectors of the economy.

For K-12 educators today, this represents a challenge: how can teachers infuse in their young students an interest in the new discipline of data science.

At the high school level, teaching the synthesis of mathematical, statistical and computational thinking that make up data science can lead students not only to important and well-paying careers, but it can also eradicate the inequities built into the calculus pathway. In most districts in the U.S., high-achieving students engage in what is known as a “race to calculus,” missing courses in middle school to get to the calculus pinnacle. 

Yet research shows that most students who take calculus in school repeat it or take a lower-level course in college. The need to compress courses to reach calculus also means that most students are filtered out of the pathway in middle school, and the students chosen to go forward are disproportionately white and male. Data science provides a more equitable alternative to calculus that will not require middle school tracking, and will connect with students’ daily lives and communities, raise awareness of social-justice issues, and appeal to broader groups of students.

Our goal in setting out these standards is not to claim that they are the only way to develop data literacy through the grades, but to raise awareness and to start or enrich conversations happening . Some highlights of the data science standards we propose include students developing curiosity about events in their lives that can be considered with data, learning to pose their own statistical investigative questions on topics that interest and affect them, and confronting the ethical implications of data collection and analysis.
