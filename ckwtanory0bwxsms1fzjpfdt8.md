The term website integration describes the collective process completed by a team

managers, SEO and SEM specialists, designers, user accessibility specialists, systems 
analysts, software developers, HTML coders, technical architects, testers, and operations 
specialists.
The person who assumes the role of website integrator must have highly developed 
technical and project management skills to see the website update through from start to 
finish. Here are the contacts whom website integrators usually work with from the client 
company.

What Are the Benefits of Website Integrations?
Successful marketers understand that the customer experience has become paramount 
over the last several years. In other words, how your organization reaches customers is as 
important as the products and services your company offers. Prospective customers expect 
support at every stage of the buying journey, which becomes more challenging the larger 
your company grows. Having an integrated website is a simple solution to this common 
dilemma. Here are several other benefits your business can expect when investing in 
website integrations.
 Improved customer profiling is necessary to predict what customers might purchase 
and their lifetime value to the company. Website integration provides access to more 
data to allow your business to build robust customer profiles. Better profiles lead to 
improved customer service and personalization.
 The sales pipeline, which includes lead generation and qualification, selling to 
qualified leads, closing a sale, and post-sale support, requires effort at every stage. 
Investing in website integrations improves efficiency at each pipeline stage by 
automating many of the processes.
Once you understand website integrations and their benefits, the next step is to decide 
which ones would benefit your business the most.
