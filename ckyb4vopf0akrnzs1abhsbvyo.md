DEEP LEARNING

INTRODUCTION: 

       Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. Itâ€™s achieving results that were not possible before.

IMPRESSIVE RESULTS OF DEEP LEARNING:


In a word, accuracy. Deep learning achieves recognition accuracy at higher levels than ever before. This helps consumer electronics meet user expectations, and it is crucial for safety-critical applications like driverless cars. Recent advances in deep learning have improved to the point where deep learning outperforms humans in some tasks like classifying objects in images.

1.Deep learning requires large amounts of labeled data. For example, driverless car developmenarchitecture that is efficient for deep learning. When combined with clusters or cloud computing, this enables development teams to reduce training time for a deep learning network from weeks to hours or less.


Examples of Deep Learning at Work :

Automated Driving: 


Automotive researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect objects such as stop signs and traffic lights. In addition, deep learning is used to detect pedestrians, which helps decrease accidents.


Aerospace and Defense:

 Deep learning is used to identify objects from satellites that locate areas of interest, and identify safe or unsafe zones for troops.


Medical Research: 

Cancer researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at UCLA built an advanced microscope that yields a high-dimensional data set used to train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells.

Industrial Automation: 

Deep learning is helping to improve worker safety around heavy machinery by automatically detecting when people or objects are within an unsafe distance of machines.

Electronics: 

Deep learning is being used in automated hearing and speech translation. For example, home assistance devices that respond to your voice and know your preferences are powered by deep learning applications.
