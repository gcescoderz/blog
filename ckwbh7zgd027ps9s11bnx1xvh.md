## Application


An application, also referred to as an application program or application software, is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application.An application can be self-contained or a group of programs. The program is a set of operations that runs the application for the user.

Types of application
• Mobile Application
• web Application
• Hybrid Application
 
Mobile Application

For example, a mobile application developer writes their code as a native, web or hybrid application -- and these terms can also describe desktop applications. The developer codes a native application to run on specific hardware, such as a camera or GPS, and in the same programming language as the underlying OS. For example, the Photos application on Mac OS X is written in Objective-C, which is the same language that Mac OS X uses.

Web Application

An end user typically accesses a web application via a web browser, such as Google Chrome. A developer can write web applications in several languages, including JavaScript, CSS and HTML, but they cannot access the hardware on which the application is installed. 

Hybrid Application

Hybrid applications have APIs that can access device resources, similar to a native application, but are typically written in languages such as HTML and CSS. Additionally, developers often code mobile applications to work on a specific device platform.

I have recommended some YouTube video to know about the application softwares
